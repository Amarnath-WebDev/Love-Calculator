# Love Calculator

This is a simple love calculator web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  It takes two names as input and generates a random "love score" between 0% and 100%.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/Amarnath-WebDev/Love-Calculator.git`
2. **Open `index.html`** in your web browser.
3. **Enter two names** in the input fields.
4. **Click the "Calculate" button.**
5. The calculated love score will be displayed below.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML:**  Provides the basic structure of the page.
* **CSS:** Styles the page for visual appeal.
* **JavaScript:** Adds interactivity and calculates the love score.

## Future Enhancements

* Improve the user interface with more styling and animations.
* Add error handling for invalid input.
